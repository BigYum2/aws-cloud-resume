							<p>Pictured above is an infrastructure I designed for a financial management application that tracks fund performance and uses servers that emulate Windows desktops. This application also is able to scale appropriately and has an internet-facing endpoint that will balance traffic to multiple back end resources 
							   Incoming traffic is routed through HTTPS and there are no compute or storage resources that are directly accessable from the internet. The compute resources authenticate external storage to retrieve a .war file whenever there is a new code deployment.
							   Information about fund performance is read from and written to by the application and stored in a highly available Microsoft-based SQL database.

							<h1 class="major">This website is built in and hosted by AWS!</h1>
							<p>-This site's files are hosted in an AWS s3 bucket that is only accessable through https. </p>
							<p>-The domain is registered in AWS route 53 </p>
							<p>-A website counter was created using javascript and the data for it is stored in a dynamoDB table. </p>
							<p>-A lambda function is used as an API to make a GET request to the database for the visit counter and a PUT request to update it. </p>
							<p>-The function is coded in python. </p>
							<p>-This site also has a CI/CD pipeline that uses codecommit and codepipline for source control and continuous deployment. </p>
